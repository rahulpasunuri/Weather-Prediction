Final Groups:
1) humid+wind+other

2) ice+snow

3) clounds+rain+cold

4) storms+hurricane+tornado

5) dry+sun+hot

6) I can't tell

Criterion for merging:
1) Should not have strong negative correlations inside a group.
2) Should not have strong positive correlations between groups.


By, this grouping we have split a multi-label problem to a mutli-class problem+multi-label(with small number of labels).
